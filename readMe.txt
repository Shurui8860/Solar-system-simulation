This is a simple ReadMe file with a few instructions:

There are five python documents: body, simulation, dataProvider, experiments, and main

The main function is under the main file


Files are easy to follow. 

Other text files will(may) be created while running the code, I kept them there in case the program fail to create new text file named that.


The program should first animate the motions of the solar system, then the trajectory of each body is plotted.

Then, two energy graphies will be plotted, and next the average period will be written in the file called average_periods,

Afer that, the program will search for the suitable initial velocity for the satellite launching, the information will be prited on console,

After the suitable initial velocity is found, the animation of the launching will be shown, and the trajectory graph will be plotted.

It may take a short while to plot the graph, since I want to get a precise version.


Some codes written in comment form are test codes. I kept it there so you can try to run them if you want. 

Thank you for your patient to read this file.

Have a nice day ~ !
